            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>This initiative stemmed from the passion and dedication of Rei Elezi, a devoted fan of the Albanian
                national football team. Following the electrifying and competitive Euro 2024 qualifiers, Rei noticed the
                immense enthusiasm and excitement among fellow fans. Witnessing the fervor and support for the team, Rei
                envisioned a platform that would serve as a hub for these passionate supporters.</p>

            <p>Recognizing the upcoming Euro 2024 tournament as a momentous event for Albanian football, Rei was
                determined to create a space that would not only facilitate the journey of fans but also enhance their
                experience during this prestigious tournament. With a goal to provide comprehensive information, travel
                guidance, and an engaging platform for fans to celebrate their team, the idea for this website was born.
            </p>

            <p>Driven by an unwavering commitment to the cause, Rei worked tirelessly and collaborated with a team of
                enthusiasts, developers, and designers. Within a remarkably short span of three days, this website came
                to life, offering a one-stop destination for Albanian national team fans, enabling them to access
                valuable resources, travel tips, match schedules, and more.</p>

            <p>The essence of this platform lies in its dedication to the fans, embodying the spirit of unity, passion,
                and celebration of Albanian football. Through Rei's vision and the collective efforts of everyone
                involved, this website stands as a testament to the unwavering support and love for the national team,
                aiming to make Euro 2024 an unforgettable and joyous experience for all Albanian supporters.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p> Although it never played any matches, the Albania national football team existed before the Albanian
                    Football Association (Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit; FSHF) was created on 6 June 1930. Albania
                    joined FIFA during a congress held between 12 and 16 June. Albania played its first international
                    match against Yugoslavia in 1946, which ended in a 3–2 home defeat at Qemal Stafa Stadium.[6] In
                    1946, Albania also participated for the first time in the Balkan Cup in which Albania won by beating
                    Romania 1–0 in the final.[7] In 1954, Albania was one of the founding members of UEFA. Albania
                    waited until 1962 to compete in a Euro Cup competition and the only time Albania was between the
                    best 16 teams of the Continent, the reason being Albania got past the first leg as Greece, for
                    political reasons forfeited the game.[8][9] At the end of the tournament Albania ranked 9th in
                    Europe.[10][11][12] Albania participated at the 1964 Summer Olympics in the Men's qualification
                    tournament, and closely lost both matches against Bulgaria in the preliminary round.[13] They would
                    participate for the second and last time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in which they faced Romania at
                    the Men's European Qualifiers in the Playoffs. Albania would lose both matches close with 2–1 in the
                    first leg and 1–2 at home in the second leg.[14][15]

                <p> Albania participated for the first time in a qualifying phrase of a World Cup in the qualifiers of
                    the 1966 edition in England. The team was drawn in the Group 5 which finished in the last position
                    with only one point from six matches. In the qualifiers, of the UEFA Euro 1968 Albania had a draw
                    0–0 against West Germany that denied the Germans the participation to the UEFA Euro 1968
                    finals.[16][17] In later years, Albania did not participate in the qualifiers of the World Cup 1970,
                    UEFA Euro 1976, World Cup 1978 and UEFA Euro 1980 for unknown political reasons. After six years
                    without playing any international matches, Albania entered in the qualifiers of the World Cup 1982,
                    managing to finish in a place other than last for the first time in a qualifying match, with Finland
                    getting last place instead. In the following qualification for the World Cup 1986 Albania were able
                    to beat famously Belgium at home in Tirana with 2–0 as well as drawing away in Mielec against Poland
                    with 2–2 despite leading until the end of this match. Their last point were won against Greece at
                    home. Missing out close for their first ever FIFA World Cup as they finished third in the standings.
                    The qualifiers of the World Cup 1990 were probably the worst qualifier in Albania's history as there
                    were 6 losses in as many games with no memorable matches.
